# Self

* Our sense of time is highly inaccurate, influenced chiefly by the novelty or familiarity of what happens rather than by strict chronological duration.
* We desire excessively and inaccurately.
* Our sexual drives wreak havoc on our sense of priorities. * Our whole assessment of the world can be transformed according to how much water we have drunk or the amount of sleep we have had.
